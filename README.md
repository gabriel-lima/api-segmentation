# Challenge

See how consuming the API Segmentation through [Doc API](DOCS.md) 

### Prerequisites

You need have installed python=3.6.2 and Postgres=9.6.4. But, if you want a shortcut to set up this application I created a Docker configuration.

### Installing

With Docker you need just run:

```
docker-compose build
```

### Running server

To run with Docker, you need just:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Or at folder /project, run:
```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

The application running in `http://localhost:8000`.

## Running the tests

To run all tests:
```bash
docker-compose run --rm web ./manage.py test -v2
```

Or:
```bash
./manage.py test -v2
```
